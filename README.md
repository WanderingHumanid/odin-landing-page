# odinlandingpage

This is a project assigned to me by The Odin Project.

It is a simple homepage for a website, that lists out some necessary informations in 4 sections.

The website is built entirely using HTML & CSS, with a special emphasis on the CSS Flexbox properties.

I have simply used placeholder models for the items in this page, so you can modify it into your needs by simply changing the values.
